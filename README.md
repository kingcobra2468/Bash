## What is this Repo?

This repo is a collection of scripts/utilities that I have made over the last 3+ years. Scripts serve different purposes with some of them in dire need of refactoring :)

## Repo Schema
The repo is split into 4 main subsections

* miss/ - contains random scripts/testers
* administration/ - contains system setup (another repo to be made public soon) and other utils for system setup
* networking - various network related scripts
* utilities - scripts for automating and speeding up my daily workflows
